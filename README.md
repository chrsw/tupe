Most of the exercises were run on Ubuntu 20.04 or Devuan 5. Many of the C code examples and excerpts were updated for a more modern style of C: C89/C90/ANSI/ISO. For a more accurate experience of the text, search for access to an older UNIX system more like the authors were familiar with at the time of publishing.

This is for my own learning and practice. You can find other places for the code and higher quality solutions, I'm sure.
