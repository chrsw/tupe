# The UNIX Programming Environment

This repo is for hosting code, examples and solutions from "The UNIX Programming Environment" by Kernighan and Pike, 1978, Prentice-Hall.
The code in this repo has been updated for ANSI C. Generally C89 standard.


Most of the exercises were run on Ubuntu 20.04 or Devuan 5. I did not look
for access to an older UNIX system the authors were familiar with at the
time of writing.
