# The UNIX Programming Environment

This repo is for hosting code, examples and solutions from "The UNIX Programming Environment" by Kernighan and Pike, 1978, Prentice-Hall.

Most of the exercises were run on Ubuntu 20.04 or Devuan 5. For a more accurate experience of the text, search for access to an older UNIX system more like the authors were familiar with at the time of publishing.
