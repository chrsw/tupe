Exercise 3-2. Explain the output produced by

	$ ls .*


Solution 3-2
This command lists every file and the contents of every directory whose names
begin with '.'. The shell expands the asterisk '*' character to match any
string. So all files that start with a dot '.' and anything else are passed
to `ls` as arguments. The parent directory an not all of the contents of the
current directory are printed because the '.' and '..' are special directories
that don't match in shell expansions. So the list of files passed to `ls` as
arguments doesn't include '.' or '..'.
