Exercise 3-4. How do you tell `grep` to search for a pattern beginning with a
'-'? Why doesn't quoting the argument help? Hint: investigate the -e option.


Solution 3-4
Using the version of `grep` from one of the test systems (Devuan Linux 5),
`grep` will find lines with a leading dash '-'.

	$ grep ^- ex3-4_test.txt

It looks like the version of grep described in the text
is rather old and newer versions of grep, like the one used on the test
system already includes the -e option referred to by the text by default?
