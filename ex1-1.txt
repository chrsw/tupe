Exercise 1-1. Explain what happens with

$ date\@

Solution 1-1.
The shell escapes the '@' because of the preceding backslash '\'. Now
instead of the '@' being used for its normal meaning, a line kill character
according to the text, the shell tries to execute a command with the name
'date@' which likely doesn't exist. The following output is from the test
machine this exercise was run on.
$ date\@
bash: date@: command not found
