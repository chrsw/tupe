Exercise 2-6. Why does `ls -l` report 4 links to recipes? Hint: try

	$ ls -ld /usr/you
	$ ls -ld /home/chris

Why is this information useful?


Solution 2-6
$ mkdir recipis
$ cd recipes
$ pwd
/home/chris/upe/recipes
$ mkdir pie cookie
$ ed pie/apple
...
$ ed cookie/choc.chip
...
$ cd ..
$ ls -l | grep recipes

`ls -l` reports 4 links to recipes because there are 4 directories (files)
"in" the recipes directory: '.', '..', 'pie', 'cookie'. The link count
can be used to tell how many files are in a directory.
