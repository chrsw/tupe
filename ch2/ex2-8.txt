Exercise 2-8.  `cp` doesn't copy subdirectories, it just copies files at the
first level of a hierarchy. What does it do if one of the argument files is a
 directory? Is this kind or even sensible? Discus the relative merits of the
possibilities: an option to `cp` to descent directories, a separate command 
`rcp` (recursive copy) to do the job, or just having cp copy a directory
recursively when it finds one. See Chapter 7 for help on providing this
facility. What other programs would profit from the ability to traverse the
directory tree?


Solution 2-8
On the test system, `cp` does not copy recursively by default:

	$ cp test2 test1/
	cp: -r not specified; omitting directory 'test2'

The option -r can be used to copy directories:

	$ cp -r test2 test1/
	$ ls test1/
	test2

A separate command, such as `rcp`, would work for this task. Although it's
another command to remember and these days there is already a popular utility
called `rcp` (remote copy between hosts).
Added an option to `cp` for recursive copy support is probably the best option
and probably the most commonly used method at the time this exercise solution
was written (summer 2024). It doesn't break the Unix Philosophy (do one thing
only, do it well) because it operation is still the same.
Having `cp` quietly perform the recursive copy is probably a bad idea because
the operation could be a mistake or it may be unclear to the user exactly
what is supposed to happen.
