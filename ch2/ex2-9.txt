Exercise 2-9.  Find out about the other files in /dev by reading Section
4 of the manual. What is the difference between /dev/mt0 and /dev/rmt0?
Comment on the potential advantages of having subdirectories in /dev for
disks, tapes, etc.

Solution 2-9
The test system doesn't have /dev/mt0 or /dev/rmt0. According to internet
searches /dev/mt0 is a magnetic tape device and /dev/rmt0 is a remote
magnetic tape protocol.
The test system does have a number of other files in /dev:
disk
net
null
random
tty
zero
Subdirectories in /dev are an advantage because they promote greater
organization.
