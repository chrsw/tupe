Exercise 2-13.  How can you tell if a user has been active at the terminal
recently?


Solution 2-13
To tell if a user has be active the terminal recently on a modern system, use
 the `last` command.

	$ last | head -n 2
	chris    :0.0         :0.0             Sat Jul 13 15:09    gone - no logout
	reboot   system boot  6.1.0-10-amd64   Sat Jul 13 15:09   still running

The text does not mention this command, it was probably implemented after the
text was published. Based on the material presented in the text, another
solution could be the `who` command as a root:

	$ sudo who
	chris    pts/3        2024-07-14 20:51

Perhaps another option, more aligned with the spirit of the text is to find
out what terminal a user is connected to and list the details of that
terminal device to see when it was last modified:
	
	$ tty
	/dev/pts/1
	$ date && ls -l /dev/pts/1
	Sun Jul 14 09:04:22 PM EDT 2024
	crw------- 1 chris tty 136, 1 Jul 14 21:04 /dev/pts/1

Or perhaps yet another way is to use `grep` to filter the list of terminal
devices for the user you're interested in:

	$ ls -l /dev/pts | grep chris
	crw------- 1 chris tty  136, 0 Jul 14 21:05 0
	crw------- 1 chris tty  136, 1 Jul 14 21:05 1
	crw------- 1 chris tty  136, 2 Jul 14 14:23 2

The most recently modified terminal device file is the last activity for the
user.
