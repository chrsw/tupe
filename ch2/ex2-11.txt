Exercise 2-11.  Why isn't /dev/tty just a link to your login terminal? What
would happen if it were mode rw--w--w- like your login terminal?


Solution 2-11
If /dev/tty were a link to a user's login terminal then only one user can
use the /dev/tty facility at a time.
/dev/tty details:
$ ls -l /dev/tty
crw-rw-rw- 1 root tty 5, 0 Jun 14 22:32 /dev/tty
login terminal details:
$ ls -l `tty`
crw--w--w- 1 chris tty 136, 0 Jun 14 22:34 /dev/pts/0
If /dev/tty were rw--w--w- then programs like `crypt` wouldn't be able to
read from the user's terminal.
