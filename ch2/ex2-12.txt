Exercise 2-12.  How does write(1) work? Hint: see utmp(5).

Solution 2-12

	$ whatis write
	write (1)            - send a message to another user

write(1) uses utmp records to find terminal devices for each logged in user
then uses system level privileges to send a message to each device, which are 
-rw--w--w- by default.
