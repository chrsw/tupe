Exercise 2-10. Tapes written on non-UNIX systems often have different
block sizes, such as 800 bytes -- ten 80-character card images -- but the
tape device /dev/mt0 expects 512-byte blocks. Look up the dd command
(dd(1)) to see how to reach such a tape.


Solution 2-10
According to the test system dd(1), the option to specify block size is
'bs':

	bs=BYTES
		read and write up to BYTES at a time
