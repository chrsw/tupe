Exercise 2-2

Given the information in this section, you should be able to understand roughly
how the 'ls' command operates.
Hint: cat . >foo; ls -f foo.

'cat' copies the contents of a file to standard output. The file passed to 'cat'
in this example is '.', the current directory. In UNIX, directories are lists of
files. Effectively, 'cat' is a list of files that happens to be the current
directory. This means the list of files in the current directory will be written
to standard output. The '>' shell redirection operator sends the data that would
normally be written to standard output into the file named after the '>', which
is a file called 'foo'.
Note this does not work on Ubuntu 20.04:
$ cat . >foot
cat: .: Is a directory
