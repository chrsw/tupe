Exercise 1-7. Explain the difference between

	$ who | sort

and

	$ who >sort

Solution 1-7
$ who | sort
`who` prints a list of currently logged in users and their login details.
The output of `who` is piped into the `sort` application. `sort` runs
with its standard input coming from the pipeline. The pipeline sends
the output of the `who` command into the input of `sort`. `sort` sorts the
input and prints the output. In other words, the output is a sorted list of
logged users and some of the login details.

$ who > sort
This time the output of who is sent into a file named 'sort'. A new file
is created if a file named 'sort' does not exist. If the file 'sort' exists
then it is overwritten with the list of currently logged in users.
