Exercise 1-5. Explain why

$ ls > ls.out

causes ls.out to be included in the list of names.


Solution 1-5
ls.out is included in the list of names because the shell needs to create
the file output is redirected to before the command is executed. When the
'ls' command finally runs, ls.out is already on the file system to be
found but 'ls'.
