Exercise 2-4.`du` was written to monitor disk usage. Using it to find files
in a directory is at best a strange idiom, and perhaps inappropriate. As
an alternative, look at the manual page for find(1), and compare the two
commands. In particular, compare the command du -a| grep ... with the
corresponding invocation of find. Which runs faster. Is it better to 
build a new tool or use a side effect of an old one?
