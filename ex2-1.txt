Exercise 2-1. What happens when you type ctl-d to ed? Compare this to the
command

	$ ed <file


Solution 2-1
ctl-d sends EOF to `ed` which closes the 'file', being standard input, the
keyboard. This is similar to the example command where the EOF is sent to
`ed` after all bytes in 'file' are sent. In the example command, the contents
of 'file' are treated as commands for `ed`. The commands stop when EOF is
sent after all 'file' bytes are sent.
