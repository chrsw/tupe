Exercise 5-18.  Add option -v to 'replace' to print all changed lines on
/dev/tty. Strong hint: s/$left/$right/g$vflag.


Solution 5-18
See ex5-18_replace for solution. The `replace` example was modified to look
for a -v option using the command line argument position facility. The `sed`
command was modified to add a flag to print matching lines to /dev/tty.
Tested on Ubunut 20.04.

The `overwrite` script was made executable. The current directory was added
to the path PATH of the ex5-18_replace script. ex5-18_test.txt is the test
input/output file.

$ chmod +x overwrite.*
$ ln -s overwrite.3 overwrite
$ cat ex5-18_test.txt 
aaBBBaaBBaBBBBBaaa
./ex5-18_replace -v B A ex5-18_test.txt 
aaAAAaaAAaAAAAAaaa
