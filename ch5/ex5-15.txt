Exercise 5-15.  Look up the times the shell built-in, and add a line to
your .profile so that when you log off the shell prints how much CPU time you
have used.


Solution 5-15
The Bash source has been installed into
~/proj/bash-src/bash-5.0/builtins
`times` built-in source installed into
/home/chris/proj/bash-src/bash-5.0/builtins/times.def
.def files are meant to be pre-processed by a tool that generates the C
source file implementing the built-in function.
The times() built-in function source was generated in
~/proj/bash-src/bash-5.0/lib/sh/times.c
On the test system, the `times` built-in is implemented as a C function,
not as a shell script.

For the solution to this exercise, one possiblity is to take the C source
from the Bash times built-in and use that code to write a new C program
that can included for execution in .profile.
Another option is to write a Bash shell version of this built-in and include
the Bahe shell code in .profile.
