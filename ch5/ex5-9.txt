Exercise 5-9. Look at the implementation of `true` and `false` in `/bin` or `/usr/bin`. (How would you find where they are?)


Solution 5-9
To find where `true` and `false` are on the system one can try:

    $ which true || which false
    /usr/bin/true
    /usr/bin/false

To find what types of files these are, one can use the `file` utility:

    $ (file `which true` && file `which false`) | awk -F',' '{print $1}'
    /usr/bin/true: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object
    /usr/bin/false: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object

Since these are both executable files, the source package where these files
come from would need to be inspected.

    $ apt-get source coreutils
    $ find coreutils-8.30 -type f -iregex '.*true.c' -print && find coreutils-8.30 -type f -iregex '.*false.c' -print
    coreutils-8.30/src/true.c
    coreutils-8.30/src/false.c

The are C programs. The implementation of both `ture` and `false` essentially
boil down to:

int
main()
{
    return EXIT_SUCCESS; // or EXIT_FAILURE
}

Perhaps another way to do this is with a shells script.
