Exercise 5-5.  Since the shell uses `esac` to terminate a `case` and `fi` to
terminate an `if`, why does it use `done` to terminate a `do`?

Solution 5-5
Maybe the shell uses `done` to terminate a `do` because `od` is already a
command:

	$ which od
	/usr/bin/od
	$ whatis od
	od (1)               - dump files in octal and other formats
