Exercise 5-12:  Write a version of 'watchwho' that stores the who output in
a shell variable instead of files. Which version do you prefer? Which version
runs faster? Should 'watchwho' and 'checkmail' do & automatically?


Solution 5-12
See ex5-12_watchwho. The output of `who` is stored in variable first, then
a file. This version will be slower since it involves an extra variable step.
The test system's POSIX shell doesn't support sub-shell redirection like the
Bash shell:

    $ diff <(echo $who1) <(echo $who2)

Which would be useful and perhaps faster in this case.
