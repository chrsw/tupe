Exercise 5-12:  Write a version of 'watchwho' that stores the who output in
a shell variable instead of files. Which version do you prefer? Which version
runs faster? Should 'watchwho' and 'checkmail' do & automatically?


Solution 5-12
See ex5-12_watchwho. The output of `who` is stored in variable first, then
a file. This version will be slower since it involves an extra variable step.
The test system's POSIX shell doesn't support sub-shell redirection like the
Bash shell:

    $ diff <(echo $who1) <(echo $who2)

For the Bash version, see ex5-12_watchwho.bash. It's difficult to benchmark
these because they run so fast on modern systems like the test system. The
Bash version has extra processing in the 'awk' portion to skip blank lines.


'watcho' and 'checkmail' do not need & automatically. & will free up the
terminal but will make the commands harder to kill/exit. A better solution
would be to run the commands in another terminal or a virtual terminal.
