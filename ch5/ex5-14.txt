Exercise 5-14.  The version of `nohup` above combines the standard error
of the command with the standard output. Is this a good design? If not, how
would you separate them cleanly?


Solution
It's probably not the best to design to combine both standard error and
standard output.
Now downstream commands in the pipeline will have both standard error and
standard output combined into one file stream. This is not ideal. See
ex5-14_nohup for a version of nohup that does not do this.

On the test system, `nohup` is already a command:
$ file /usr/bin/nohup
/usr/bin/nohup: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=f9a6d76dd4a833cad9de92cfbb95ed58cefe9194, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped

The example from the text as been added to this project as ch5/nohup.
