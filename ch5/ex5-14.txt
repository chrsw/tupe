Exercise 5-14.  The version of `nohup` above combines the standard error
of the command with the standard output. Is this a good design? If not, how
would you separate them cleanly?


Solution
It's probably not the best to design to combine both standard error and
standard output. The user is normally interested in only one or the other.

On the test system, `nohup` is already a command:
$ file /usr/bin/nohup
/usr/bin/nohup: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=f9a6d76dd4a833cad9de92cfbb95ed58cefe9194, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
