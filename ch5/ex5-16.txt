Exercise 5-16.
Write a program that will find the next available user-id in /etc/passwd. If
you are enthusiastic (and have permission), make it inot a command that will
add a new user to the system. What permissions does it need? How should it
handle interrupts?


Solution 5-16
Starting with the /etc/passwd example from here:
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1.0?topic=passwords-using-etcpasswd-file
Editing this file to simplify the solution.
Instead of using the test system /etc/passwd.
Saved to the chapter 5 directory as 'passwd'.
According to `man 5 passwd`, the /etc/passwd file stores account information
for each user on one line, with seven fields delimited by colons (":").
the user-id field ("numerical user ID") is the third field in each row.
For simplicity, the solution will take a naive approach and use the next
available ID after the highest current ID in the passwd file. i.e., gaps
will not be considered.

The solution for this exercise is captured in the file ex5-16_passwd.
$ ./ex5-16_passwd 
202

This script finds the first free ID beyond the highest ID In the password
file.
