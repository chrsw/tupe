Exercise 5-13.  What is the difference between the shell : do-nothing
command and the # comment character? Are both needed?


Solution 5-13
The difference between the shell : do-nothing command and the # comment
character is that : can be used where a command is expected. # can be used
to ignore all text remaining on a line. These are different purposes and
errors will be reported if they are exchanged.
: may not always need a # comment, like extra explanation. # comments cause
the shell to ignore the rest of the line, which may not be desired either.
In fact, : and # can both be used on the same line for different purposes.
They are both needed.
