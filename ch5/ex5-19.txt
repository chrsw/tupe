Exercise 5-19.  Fix `replace` so it works regardless of the characters
in the substitution strings.


Solution 5-19
Not sure what the problem here is yet. The exercise text is clear but
the problems described haven't been encountered yet. Will need to try
some more substitution strings with uncommon/non-printable characters
to see what the real issue is. Might also depend on what version of the
tools are being used.

Maybe what the authors are looking for is for the `replace` script to look
at the substitution strings and based on the characters in the
substitution strings, use a certain `sed` s command delimiter character.
