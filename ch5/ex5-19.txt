Exercise 5-19.  Fix `replace` so it works regardless of the characters
in the substitution strings.


Solution 5-19
Not sure what the problem here is yet. The exercise text is clear but
the problems described haven't been encountered yet. Will need to try
some more substitution strings with uncommon/non-printable characters
to see what the real issue is. Might also depend on what version of the
tools are being used.

Maybe what the authors are looking for is for the `replace` script to look
at the substitution strings and based on the characters in the
substitution strings, use a certain `sed` s command delimiter character.

The file ex5-19_replace has the framework for a solution and an example
instance. This solution script is based on the `replace` example from
Section 5.5. The strategy for this solution is to look for special
characters in the substitution strings and pick a character for the `sed`
command that isn't found in the string. This isn't a general solution
because it requires every non-alphanumeric character be checked for manually.

Example usage:

    $ ./ex5-19_replace @ C ex5-19_test.txt


Potentially a general solution could be to pick any substitution character,
escape that character in the input file, apply the substitution then reverse
the replacement. But this has not been attempted.
