Exercise 5-2.  Is it worth fixing `cal` so `cal 83` prints the calendar for
1983? If so, how would you print the calendar for year 83?


Solution 5-2.  See ex5-2.sh.
The text was published in 1983. This solution was written in 2024. It makes
just as much sense for '83' to mean '2083' (in 59 years) as 1983 (41 years
ago). This solution assumes 2-digit years are in the 21st century.
To print a calendar in the actual year 83, use '083'.
