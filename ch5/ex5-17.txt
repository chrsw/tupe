Exercise 5-17.  Why doesn't `overwrite` use signal code 0 in the `trap` so
the files are removed when it exits? Hint: Try typing DEL while running
the following program:

    trap "echo exiting; exit 1" 0 2
    sleep 10


Solution 5-17
Trapping on 0 and 2 would be a mistake because the shell would execute
the command in the trap command argument twice:
$ cat trap0
trap "echo exiting; exit 1" 0 2
sleep 10

$ ./trap0
^Cexiting
exiting

Trapping on 0 only would be a mistake since the file removes the files
when exiting normally anyway.
