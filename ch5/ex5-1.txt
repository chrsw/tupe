Exercise 5-1. If users prefer your version of cal, how do you make it globally
accessible? What has to be done to put it in /usr/bin?


Solution 5-1
To make a private version of `cal`, (which is a shell script wrapper around
/usr/bin/cal) there are several options. One option is to copy the private
version of cal to /usr/bin/bcal (better cal) with root level permissions:

	$ sudo cp cal /usr/bin/bcal

/usr/bin is already in most users' path so they simply have to run the
command with:

	$ bcal

Another option is to copy `cal` to a global directory so users can copy it
to their user directories.

	$ sudo cp cal /etc/defaults/

Another option is to move the original `cal` in /usr/bin and call the new
`cal` /usr/bin/cal

	$ sudo mv /usr/bin/cal /usr/bin/ocal
	$ sudo cp cal /usr/bin/

Then edit the cal script to call /usr/bin/ocal instead of /usr/bin/cal
