Exercise 2-7. What is the difference between

	$ mv junk junk1

and
	
	$ cp junk junk1
	$ mv junk

Hint: make a link to junk and try it.

Solution 2-7
One difference between these two commands is moving retains the i-node number
of the original but copying does not. Like the Hint suggested, this can be
demonstrated with links:

	$ mkdir temp && cd temp && touch junk && ls -i && ln junk junk2 && ls -i 	&& mv junk junk1 && ls -i
	5245410 junk
	5245410 junk  5245410 junk2
	5245410 junk1  5245410 junk2
	$ mkdir temp && cd temp && touch junk && ls -i && ln junk junk2 && ls -i        && cp junk junk1 && ls -i && rm junk && ls -i
	5245405 junk
	5245405 junk  5245405 junk2
	5245405 junk  5245410 junk1  5245405 junk2
	5245410 junk1  5245405 junk2

There's another difference, copying uses more temporary disk space as moving.
But that's probably not the focus of the Exercise.
