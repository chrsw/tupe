## The UNIX Programming Environment binaries

This directory contains various executables presented in the text for convience.
Add to path:
```
export PATH=$PATH:~/proj/tupe2/bin
```

Then use the binaries from the text more closely to how the text uses them. The text appears to have `.` in the shell's PATH by default.
