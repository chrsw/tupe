# Exercise 3-18.  Modify `bundle` so it includes with each file the information 
# garnered from `ls -l`, particularly permissions and date of last change. 
# Contrast the facilities of `bundle` with the archive program ar(1).


# Solution 3-18
# bundle_3-18:  group files into distribution package, with listing details

echo '# To unbundle, sh this file'
for i
do
	info=`ls -l $i`
	echo "echo '$info'"
	#cat "echo $i 1>&2"
	echo "cat >$i <<'End of $i'"
	echo "ls -l $i"
	cat $i
	echo "End of $i"
done
