Exercise 1-6. Explain the output from

$ wc temp >temp

If you misspell a command name, as in

$ woh >temp

what happens?


Solution 1-6
On the test system:
$ cat temp
this is a list of words for exercise 1-6. the output of the wc command for a file is redirected to the same file.
$ wc temp
  1  24 114 temp
$ wc temp >temp
0 0 0 temp
What's happened is that a new blank file called 'temp' was created to redirect
the output of 'wc' to. Since this is an empty file that clobbers over the
existing temp file then 'wc' runs on an empty file and the output goes to that
same empty file. Maybe a better way to do this is
$ wc temp >>temp

For the second example, when a command is mistyped, the output goes to stderr
not stdout by default. Therefore, stdout has nothing to put in the temp
file so the result is an empty temp file. Meanwhile the error output goes
to the terminal because that's where stderr goes by default.
