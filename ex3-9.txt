Exercise 3-9.  Look in /bin and /usr/bin to see how many commands are
actually shell files. Can you do it in one command? Hint: file(1). How
accurate are guesses based on length?


Solution 3-9
Counting the shell scripts in /bin and /usr/bin with one command

	$ file /bin/* /usr/bin/* | grep -i shell | wc -l
	181

Using file sizes is reasonably accurate for bin (22 files 8k or less)
but less accurate for /usr/bin (222 files 8k or less).
