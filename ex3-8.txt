Exercise 3-8.  If you type

	$ rm *

why can't `rm` warn you that you're about to delete all your files?

Solution 3-8
`rm` doesn't warn you because the shell expands * into a list of files
some of which may match, some wont. So all `rm` sees is a list of files,
it doesn't know that's all the files in the current directory.
On the test system this commend does not produce a warning.
