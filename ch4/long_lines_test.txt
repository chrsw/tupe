this is a text file containing very long lines that go past eighty characters per line.
the point of this file is to test the functionality of programs, utilities, scripts, etc. that are specifically designed to process long lines of text.
for example, the AWK program 'fold' from Section 4.4 and the exercises based on fold's code.
here's a short line just for test coverage.
finally, here is another long line after the first short line to test how the code handles this scenario too.
