Exercise 4-4.  Write a word counting program in your favorite programming
language and compare its size, speed and maintainability with the word-
counting pipeline. How easily can you convert it into a spelling checker?

Solution 4-4.
See top10.c.

TODO: time different implementations. Both the pipeline implementation and C
implementations are too fast to time with basic tools (time built-in,
/usr/bin/time).
