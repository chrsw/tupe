Exercise 4-4.  Write a word counting program in your favorite programming
language and compare its size, speed and maintainability with the word-
counting pipeline. How easily can you convert it into a spelling checker?

Solution 4-4.
See top10.c.

The C implementation is about 3 times faster than the pipeline implementation.
But the C implementation took many times longer to develop.
