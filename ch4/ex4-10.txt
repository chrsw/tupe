Exercise 4-10.  Modify `fold` so that it will fold lines at blanks or tabs
rather than splitting a word. Make it robust for long words.


Solution 4-10
The `fold` AWK script from section 4.4 reads a line, if the line is less
than 80 columns, it is printed. If it is greater than 80 columns it is
printed 80 columns at a time with no regard for word boundaries.
Thoughts
One strategy could be to go to the 80th character and read backwards until
the first blank. Then print everything between the start of the line and the
current cursor position. Then start again at the current cursor position.
Perhaps the AWK built-in function split() could be part of the solution here.
