Exercise 4-10.  Modify `fold` so that it will fold lines at blanks or tabs
rather than splitting a word. Make it robust for long words.


Solution 4-10
For an initial attempt at folding long lines, see ex4-10_fold, a shell script
based on fold from Section 4.4. This script turns input tabs into 8 spaces
using `sed` then passes the input into an AWK script. The awk script reads
a line, counts the number of words that fit in 79 characters, assumes
all spaces between words are a single space, prints the maximum amount of
words that will fit in the given column width then repeats until the line
is printed.

This approach is simple to conceive and implement but has some drawbacks.
1. It does not break long words (great than the column width)
2. It does not handle multiple consecutive spaces or spaces created from
   tabs.
3. It's not clearly written.
Hopefully one new strategy could solve all 3 issues.
One strategy could be to go to the 80th character and read backwards until
the first blank. Then print everything between the start of the line and the
current cursor position. Then start again at the current cursor position.
