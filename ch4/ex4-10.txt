Exercise 4-10.  Modify `fold` so that it will fold lines at blanks or tabs
rather than splitting a word. Make it robust for long words.


Solution 4-10
The `fold` AWK script from section 4.4 reads a line, if the line is less
than 80 columns, it is printed. If it is greater than 80 columns it is
printed 80 columns at a time with no regard for word boundaries.
Thoughts
One strategy could be to go to the 80th character and read backwards until
the first blank. Then print everything between the start of the line and the
current cursor position. Then start again at the current cursor position.
Perhaps the AWK built-in function split() could be part of the solution here.
The sed command in the beginning of fold already includes spaces to tabs
substitution, so that doesn't need to be a consideration for the folding
on word boundary, any space is a word boundary.
Example run using fold from text:
$ cat long_lines_test.txt | ./fold 
this is a text file containing very long lines that go past eighty characters pe\
                                                                         r line.
the point of this file is to test the functionality of programs, utilities, scri\
         pts, etc. that are specifically designed to process long lines of text.
for example, the AWK program 'fold' from Section 4.4 and the exercises based on \
                                                                    fold's code.
here's a short line just for test coverage.
finally, here is another long line after the first short line to test how the co\
                                                   de handles this scenario too.
