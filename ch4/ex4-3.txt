Exercise 4-3.  Use the tools in this section to write a simple spell checker.
What are its shortcomings, and how would you address them?


Solution 4-3
Idea:
Try taking each word sent in via standard input and search for that word in
the test system's dictionary file: /usr/share/dict/words.
If there is no match, print the word to standard output.
For the solution see the file `check`. This solution is focused on simplicity
and brevity rather than handling all types of cases.
