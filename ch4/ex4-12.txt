Exercise 4-12.  Should `calendar` know about dates inside a line, not
just at the beginning? How about dates expressed in other formats, like
10/1/83?


Solution 4-12.
No calendar should not know about dates inside a line. Dates inside a
line are typically just references to other lines. Find these dates
inside other lines would add unnecessary complexity to the application.

Dates in other formats can be implemented in the calendar app but
probably should be specified with a command line switch rather than
the app trying to figure out the date format by itself. This would
simplify the design off the app. This means mixed date formats would
not be accepted.
