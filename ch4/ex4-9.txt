Exercise 4-9.  The output from `wordfreq` includes text from formatting
commands like .CW, which is used to print words in `this font`. How would
you get rid of such non-words? How would you use `tr` to make wordfreq work
properly regardless of the case of its input? Compare the implementation
and performance of `wordfreq` to the pipeline from Section 4.2 and to
this one:

    sed `s/[\t][\t]*/\
    /g` $* | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr


Solution 4-9
One possible way to get rid of non-words like .CW from the wordfreq
output is to only add to the word count hash if the word matches
a word found in an online dictionary like /usr/share/dict/words,
which exists on the test system but may not on your system.
The 2nd part of the exercise is to make the wordfreq AWK script case
insensitive. This can be done with the a 'tr' call in the command
pipeline.
See ex4-9_wordfreq.awk.
Performance. The text states " Compare the implementation
and performance of `wordfreq` to the pipeline from Section 4.2 and to
this one:

    sed `s/[ \t][ \t]*/\
    /g` $* | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

Section 4.2's word counting pipeline:

cat $* |
tr -sc A-Za-z '\012' |
sort |
uniq -c |
sort -n |
tail |
5

The last command, '5' is just for formatting the output.
