Exercise 4-13.  Why doesn't `calendar` use getname instead of $NAME?


Solution 4-13
Using $NAME ensures mail is sent to the user running or scheduling calendar
reguardless of how it's invoked.
$ sudo echo $NAME
chris
$ sudo ./getname 
root
The `at` man page explains a little about this:
"If at is executed from a su(1) shell, the owner of the login 
shell will receive the mail."
