Exercise 3-11.  Try

	$ `date`

and explain the result.


Solution 3-11

	$ `date`
	bash: Sat: command not found

The `date` command is executed and the output is passed to the shell for
the shell to execute. The output of the `date` command happens to be
"Sat Apr 27 04:15:00 PM EDT 2024" so the shell attempts to execute a command
called `Sat` with the rest of the input as arguments to the command.
Naturally no such command `Sat` exists so the shell reports an error.
