Exercise 3-5. Consider

	$ echo */*

Does this produce all names in all directories? In what order do the names
appear?


Solution 3-5
This command lists all file names in all directories, except for files leading
with '.'. The order of the files depends on the shell expansion, which on
the test system is alphabetically ascending.
