Exercise 5-3. Modify `cal` to accept more than one month, as in

	$ cal oct nov

or perhaps a range of months:

	$ cal oct - dec

If it's now December and you ask for cal jan, should you get this year's
January or next year's?  When should have stopped adding features to `cal`.


Solution 5-3
For a version of `cal` that accepts a list of months, see ex5-3.sh. This
version calls `cal` for each month on the script command line.
If it's now December and `cal` is asked to print the calendar for the month
of January, the logical thing to do is to print the calendar for the month
of January of NEXT year, since that's what most users would be interested in.
It would be better to not add too many features to `cal`. Let other tools
build an appropriate command line for `cal` so it is not burdened with too
many tasks.
