Exercise 2-3. How does the `pwd` command operate?


Solution 2-4.
It depends on the `pwd`. A trivial solution is to print the name of the current directory for the pwd process.
On the test system, pwd is part of the Coreutils package and includes running 
lstat() on "." then starts calculating the full path to the current directory from there.
