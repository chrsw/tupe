Exercise 3-12.

	$ grep -l pattern filenames

lists the filenames in which there was a match of pattern, but produces no
other output. Try some variations on

	$ command `grep -l pattern filenames`


Solution 3-12
This pattern finds files that contain a match to pattern and passes them as
arguments to `command`. For example:

	$ file `grep -i -l bash *`
	ex1-1.txt:  ASCII text
	ex1-2.txt:  ASCII text
	ex1-3.sh:   Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable

Runs `file`, which prints the type of file passed as an argument, on each
file that contains a match of the string `bash`.
