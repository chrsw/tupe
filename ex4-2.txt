Exercise 4-2.  The structure of `grep` is to read a single line, check for a
match, then loop. How would `grep` be affected if regular expressions could
match newlines?


Solution 4-2
The matching engine in `grep` would have to be completely rewritten to support
new lines. Looking for patterns that cross line boundaries would also likely
have an impact on performance too. The test system has an option to match
with newlines in the regex using the -P (for Perl regex) option. A different
regex library is linked to the `grep` tool in order to use this option.
