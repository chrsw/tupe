Exercise 6-4.  The availability of C source code is one of the strengths of
the UNIX system -- the code illustrates elegant solutions to many programming
problems. Comment on the trade-off between readability of the C source and
the occasional optimizations obtained from rewriting in assembly language.


Solution 6-4
Implementing programs in C and assembly both have their weakness and strengths.
The trade-offs chosen depends on the application of the program and the goals.
For teaching, portability, re-usability and application development time, C is
the better choice. For very tight application specific and platform specific
code, assembly could be the better choice. There isn't a one-size-fits-all
solution but the vast majority of applications can be implemented in C.
