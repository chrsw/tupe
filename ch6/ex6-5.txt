Exercise 6-5.  Write a program `printable` that prints the name of each
argument file that contains only printable characters; if the file contains any
non-printable character, the name is not printed. `printable` is useful in
situations like this:

	$ pr `printable *` | lpr

Add the option -v to invert the sense of the test, as in `grep`. What should
`printable` do if there are no filename arguments? What status should
`printable` return?
