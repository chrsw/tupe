Exercise 6-3.  Change the `-s` argument so that `vis -sn` will print only
strings of n or more consecutive printable characters, discarding non-
printing characters and short sequences of printable characters. This is
valuable for isolating the text parts of non-text files such as executable
programs. Some versions of the system provide a `strings` program that does
this. Is it better to have a separate program or an argument to `vis`?


Solution 6-3
See ex6-3_vis.c.
