Exercise 6-3.  Change the `-s` argument so that `vis -sn` will print only
strings of n or more consecutive printable characters, discarding non-
printing characters and short sequences of printable characters. This is
valuable for isolating the text parts of non-text files such as executable
programs. Some versions of the system provide a `strings` program that does
this. Is it better to have a separate program or an argument to `vis`?


Solution 6-3
See ex6-3_vis.c.

It is better to have a separate program discard non-printing characters and
short strings of printing characters, like the `strings` program. Part of
the UNIX philosophy is that programs should be simple and do one thing or
a small amount of related things. Larger and more complex programs can be
built from collecting different smaller simple programs. Its easier to think
about the interactions between smaller programs using well defined interfaces
than it is to build larger monolithic programs that do many different things.
