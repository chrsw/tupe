Exercise 3-1. What are the differences among the following three commands?

	$ cat file | pr
	$ pr <file
	$ pr file


Solution 3-1.
These three commands are basically the same. The first command sends the
contents of 'file' to `pr` input stream. The second command redirects
`pr` input stream to come from file instead of standard input. The third
command passes the 'file' name to pr as a command argument, which `pr` then
takes as a file to open. In the first two commands 'file' is not opened.
