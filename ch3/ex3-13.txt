Exercise 3-13.  Why do we always include the current directory in PATH? Where
should it be placed?


Solution 3-13
The PATH variable stores a list of directories where shell looks for commands
that it is told to execute. The shell starts with the first directory in
the PATH and if the executable file that matches the name of the command is
found in that directory then the search stops and the file is executed. If
there is no file that matches the name of the command given to the shell
then the shell looks for the executable file in the next directory and
so on.
It is convenient to put the current directory, `.` in the PATH variable, as
the text suggests, but in modern practice this is not commonly done for
security reasons. Malicious software can trick a user into executing a
binary dropped into the current directory. On the test system, the current
directory is not included in the PATH by default.
