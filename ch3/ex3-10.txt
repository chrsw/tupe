Exercise 3-10.  If the backslashes are omitted in

	$ echo `echo \`date\``

what happens?

Solution 3-10
The word "date" is printed

	$ echo `echo `date``
	date

Instead of `date` executing, the word "date" is passed as an argument to the
inner `echo`, which prints "date". The string "date" is passed to the outer
`echo` which also prints "date.
