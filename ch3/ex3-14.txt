Exercise 3-14.  Compare the here-document version of 411 with the original.
Which is easier to maintain? Which is a better basis for general service?


Solution 3-14
The original version of 411 is `411`. The here-document version of 411 is
`411_sec3-7`. The here-document version might be easier to maintain because
it is all contained in one file but the original might be easier to deploy
since it allows users to write their own scripts for searching the on-
line phone book. The latter is how most databases are implemented on Unix
systems.
